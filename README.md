This project began in June 2022 as an opportunity to learn web scraping using the language R inside the RStudio (now POSIT) IDE.  Quickly the project got more involved as I saw opportunities to learn and practice mapping skills, time series ML predictions, and so much more around data wrangling, plotting and visualizations, performing statistical tests, geocoding, and more web scraping with Python when I ran into a roadblock with an R package and a finicky web page.  

Despite the heavy nature of the material, this has been a fun and interesting project, and I have learned so much from the R community that I hope that I can begin to repay that debt to some extent with this project.  I think some aspect of what is contained within will help make some analyst's or data scientist's life easier, and that is the experience I have had with R and the R community - free and open software and generous widespread sharing of knowledge.  

The beauty of R is that I will share this analysis with everyone, and, if anyone is skeptical or curious, which people should be, they can get the same data and challenge my findings and conclusions with their own analysis.  I invite you to do so, if you are so inclined.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to chat as I invite all constructive criticism.
